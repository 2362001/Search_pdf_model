Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, reason, and make decisions. AI is not limited to just robotics, but also includes machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and more.

Today, AI is increasingly being used across industries, from healthcare and finance to education and entertainment. For example, AI algorithms can assist doctors in diagnosing diseases, enable financial institutions to detect fraud, and power recommendation systems on streaming platforms.

One of the key areas of AI is deep learning, which mimics the human brain using neural networks with multiple layers. This allows machines to analyze vast amounts of data and find patterns without explicit programming.

Despite its benefits, AI raises ethical concerns. Issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and job displacement are being actively debated by experts, governments, and companies. Ensuring responsible AI development is crucial to building trust in these technologies.

In the future, AI is expected to become even more integrated into our daily lives, making tasks more efficient and enhancing human capabilities.
