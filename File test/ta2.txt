Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These changes may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the dominant cause — primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.

The burning of these fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket around the Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures. The result has been a steady rise in global temperatures, with significant effects on ecosystems, biodiversity, and sea levels.

Climate change has already intensified droughts, storms, and wildfires. It also threatens agricultural productivity and fresh water supplies. Countries around the world have begun to take action by adopting renewable energy sources, creating carbon markets, and setting emission reduction targets.

International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit global warming to well below 2°C. However, achieving these goals requires global cooperation and significant technological innovation.

The science is clear: without urgent intervention, climate change will continue to disrupt natural systems and human life in profound ways.
